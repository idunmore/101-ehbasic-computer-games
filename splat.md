# splat.bas

This program required corrections to **both** the OCR/transcriptions, and adjustments to the code (syntax, logic, features) as part of porting it.

## OCR/Transcription Corrections

- Corrected damaged text, missing arithmetic operators, malformed assignments, jump ranking, and output separators.

## Porting

- Added explicit spaces before string literals following numeric PRINT items to preserve the source dialects' output under EhBASIC.
- Removed unsupported RANDOM/RANDOMIZE seed statements.
- Standardized random draws on EhBASIC's sequence-advancing RND(0) form.
- Replaced backslash statement separators with EhBASIC colons.
